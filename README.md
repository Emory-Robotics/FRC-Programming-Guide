## Introduction

This is a guide to FIRST Robotics Programming Training.
This guide will cover all the topics needed to help train you
on how to program a robot from scratch! Each section will have a
video tutorial linked which will cover information shared in the section.

Though not required, it is highly recommend that you follow along by
completing the code labs in each section! They will help guide your
learning and ensure you have retained the information along the way!
