# Code Lab: 03 - Intro to Java

## Description

In this codelab, you will practice using the Java programming language.

**Open this codelab folder in either VSCode or IntelliJ to begin!**

### Tasks

Your editor may provide functionality to run Java files, however, recall
that you can build a java file using `javac ..files..` and then execute
using `java file`. Recall that `java file_name` will only work if `file_name`
implements a `main` method (see basic program structure).

1. Open this code-lab folder in your preferred editor and **ensure you are in your branch**
  - You should see two java files: `Main.java` and `Robot.java` 
2. Open Main.java 
  - **DO NOT** change the code in this file!
  - Use this file as a reference for the "tests" that will check the code you are about to write
3. Open Robot.java
  - Robot.java has X assignments that you will need to complete
  - Each assignment is marked by a `// TODO(LETTER): Task description`
  - Make sure to complete each letter task in order (A->Z)
  - Track your progress and any errors by compiling and running the Main file
4. When the program runs and you see "You have successfully passed all tests!"
  - Stage your changes
  - Commit your changes appropriately
  - submit a pull request from your branch
5. Keep an eye on your pull request and update and changes requested

**NOTE:** Your pull request will not be accepted, but it is important you
keep in mind any feedback proposed as well as changes requested!
