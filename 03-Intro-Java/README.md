# 03 - Intro: Java



## What is Java

Java is a very popular programming language that can be used for a wide variety
of purposes! In our case, we can use Java to program the RoboRIO, which allows
us to control the electronics on our robot. This includes sensors, motors, and pneumatics!

## Why Java

In addition to Java, we can use C++ and LabView to program FIRST robots. We choose
Java because it is easier to work with and commonly taught in schools today!
Furthermore, most Universities in College start their introductory courses in Java.
