# Code Lab: 07 - Intro to Vision

## Description

To practice what tuning the limelight might look-like,
use this simple [simulator](https://editor.p5js.org/rpilotojr10/full/x02r_3Bgn) to filter out the targets like shown in the video.
Note that this is a real image of real targets with the exposure already set.

### Tasks

Make the only remaining items on the left side the vision targets.
