# Code Lab: 10 - Intermediate Regression

## Description

Let's practice using data in a Google Sheets and creating regression lines.

### Tasks

Using this [Shooter Hood Angle Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uG65aIfGdGLpK50RxZhK4wSxSjBYGG868ZjCEHaR45o/edit?usp=sharing), create trend lines for each speed setting.
Make a copy of the sheets, and work in your document.

You should have 3 plots, one for each setting, with the trend line, equation, and R^2 value displayed.
Below the graph, write a 1-2 sentence analysis about whether or not you think this regression is good/accurate and should be used on the robot. Specify why/or why not and provide specific evidence/details.
