# 08 - Checkpoint: 2

## Description

### Create a robot command based project in this folder

### Add a drive train that can drive around using conventional joystick input

### Add a shooter superstructure than can turn motors on or off

### Add an intake superstructure that uses solenoids to intake and retrack

### Add a USB Camera so the drivers can aim

    - to allow for simulator use, make sure to put wrap this in a [simulation check](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/wpilib-tools/robot-simulation/simulation-gui.html#determining-simulation-from-robot-code)

### Test you code using the robot simulator and verify that all motors return appropriate values when triggered and the solenoids fire when buttons are pressed.
