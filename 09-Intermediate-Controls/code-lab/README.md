# Code Lab: 09 - Intermediate Controls

## Description

Let's practice tuning a PID Controller! Let's use this [overly-simplified simulator](https://editor.p5js.org/rpilotojr10/full/SZhAq8TJZ) to practice what PID gain tuning might look like when we plot the data.

Imagine the yellow line is your setpoint and your output is the blue line.

### Tasks

Play with the simulator to view how different values affect the output. Try to tune the controller so that the blue line shows a quick response with minimal overshoot.
