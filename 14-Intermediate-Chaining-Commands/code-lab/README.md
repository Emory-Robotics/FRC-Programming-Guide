# Code Lab: 14 - Intermediate: Chaining Commands

## Description

In this codelab, you will practice chaining commands to introduce complex behavior.

### Tasks

- Create a new project
- Create a drivetrain subsystem with a NavX (gyro)
- Create a shooter subsystem
- Create a drive command
- Create a shoot command which shoots balls
- Create a command group which can sequentially:
  - aim to a target (using limelight)
  - shoot a ball
- Create a command group which can in parallel:
  - aim to a target (using limelight)
  - shoot a ball
- Create a pull request and in your pull request description, describe which command group (seq. vs parallel) is better and why.
